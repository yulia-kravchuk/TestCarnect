Assumptions
1. The prototype displays different results on the same search criteria. It is treated as expected behaviour for now.
2. 

Functinal issues
1. Dropoff location field type is password, should be text.
2. Date fields are missing (failing test exists).

Other issues
1. Dropoff location field name is PickupLocation, should be DropoffLocation.

Usability
1. Pickup/Dropoff Location can have show/select on map links. It's not clear how to enter address, city etc., probably can integrate with Google Maps API.
2. Dates should have date pickers.
3. It would be nice to have currency selector (to display everything in one currency), original prices can be displayed near converted ones. 
4. Offer list can have different colours for odd and even lines. In general - some nice design is needed.
